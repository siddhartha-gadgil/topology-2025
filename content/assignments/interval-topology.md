Let `$(A, \leq)$` be a **totally ordered** set. For `$p, q\in A$` such that `$p< q$`, we define the open interval `$(p, q)$` as `$$(p, q) = \{x\in A : p < x, x < q\}.$$`

1. Show that the collection of subsets of `$A$` given by `$\{(p, q): p,q \in A, p <q \}$` forms a base for a topology on `$A$`. We call this the *interval topology*.
2. Suppose `$A$` and `$B$` are totally ordered sets and `$f: A \to B$` is a strictly increasing surjective function. Show the `$f$` is continuous with respect to the interval topologies on `$A$` and `$B$`.
3. Let `$A$` be a totally ordered set and `$B \subset A$`. We consider the total order on `$B$` obtained by restricting the order on `$A$`. **Prove or disprove:** The interval topology on `$B$` is the subspace topology with respect to the interval topology on `$A$`.
