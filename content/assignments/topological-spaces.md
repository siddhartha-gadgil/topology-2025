1. Let `$X=\{1, 2\}$`. What is the number of collections of subsets `$\Omega\subset 2^X$` that form a topology on `$X$`? Prove your answer.
2. Let `$X$` be a set, `$\Omega$` a topology on `$X$` and `$Y$` be the set obtained from `$X$` by adding a single point `$\infty$` to `$X$`. Show that `$$\{\{\infty\}\cup U: U \in \Omega\}\cup\{\phi\}$$` is a topology on `$Y$`.
