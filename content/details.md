##### Additional Resources

This course was [taught online](https://math.iisc.ac.in/~gadgil/topology-2021/index.html) in 2021. The [lectures](https://math.iisc.ac.in/~gadgil/topology-2021/all-lectures/) are online as are the [whiteboards](https://math.iisc.ac.in/~gadgil/topology-2021/Whiteboard.pdf). If you want to printout the whiteboards, please use the [compact version](./notes.pdf).

Note that students are responsible for all the material covered in the lectures this semester, which is likely to be more than that in the above resources. Experience also suggests that offline lectures are more effective. Thus, it is wise to use the above as supplements, not substitutes, for the lectures.
